# MACHINE LEARNING

This repository contains a collection of AI and Machine Learning projects developed as part of my studies and practical exercises. The projects focus on applying fundamental ML algorithms, data preprocessing, and visualization techniques to real-world datasets.

Concepts Covered:

1.Data Preparation & Visualization

2.Train-test splitting, stratified sampling

3.Standardization with StandardScaler

4.Visual exploration of datasets (Iris, Moons)

5.Machine Learning Models

6.Perceptron: Binary classification, effect of learning rates

7.Decision Region Visualization: Understanding linear vs nonlinear separability

8.Experiments on linearly separable (Iris) vs nonlinear (Moons) datasets

9.Evaluation Metrics

10.Accuracy score

11.Observing model performance limitations (e.g., Perceptron failing on nonlinear data)

Knowledge Gained:

1.Hands-on experience with supervised learning workflows (data prep → training → evaluation → visualization).

2.Understanding how learning rate affects convergence in gradient-based algorithms.

3.Recognizing the limitations of linear classifiers and the importance of model selection for nonlinear datasets.

4.Improved Python coding practices: modular functions, clean visualizations, and reproducible experiments.
